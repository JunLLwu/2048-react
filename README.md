## 2048 Recreated with ReactJS
This is a rough recreation of 2048 with ReactJS.
To try it out, clone the Git repo, build the app with npm build and run with npm start.

### To Do
- Add congratulatory message when user reaches 2048 on a tile (only the first time)
- Make page opaque when game over message is open
- Add undo button functionality (currently just starts new game) (have button be disabled when no previous board saved)
- Add functionality to save high score
- Add animations when moving tiles
- Add different color palettes (current color scheme is based off the original game)
- Clean up redundant code
